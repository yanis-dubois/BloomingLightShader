#  Minecraft Blooming Light Shaders

This repository contains a shader pack for **Minecraft** that focuses on **stylized visual fidelity** while incorporating principles from **physically-based rendering (PBR)**, **volumetric lighting**, and **post-processing**. The shader is designed to enhance immersion and atmosphere without compromising Minecraft’s distinct visual identity.

## ✨ Features

### ☀️ Lighting

- Reworked ambient lighing
- Direct lighing added with projected shadows
- Custom Ambient occlusion for environmental props
- Pixelated Lighting

### 🧱 Physically-Based Material Rendering

- **Emissivness** for light sources or luminescent objects
- **Reflectance and Roughness** to simulate all kind of material (metal, stone, wood, ice, ...)
- **Screen Space Reflections (SSR)** approximate local reflections in real time
- **Subsurface Scattering** for translucent materials
- **Porosity** simulates moisture absorption on wet surfaces
- **Normal Mapping** support through external texture packs or procedurally generated
- **Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM)** simulates surface relief using texture height maps

### 🌦️ Atmospheric Effects

- New procedural sky box
- Simulated **light shafts** with volumetric fog
- Procedural animation of foliage and water surfaces

### 🎞️ Post-Processing Pipeline

- Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)
- Bloom
- Depth of Field with **Bokeh simulation**

### 🌍 All Environments

- Overworld
- Underwater
- Nether
- End
