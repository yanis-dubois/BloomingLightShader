#  Minecraft Blooming Light Shaders

This repository contains a shader pack for **Minecraft** that focuses on stylized visual fidelity while incorporating principles from physically-based rendering (PBR), volumetric lighting, and post-processing. The shader is designed to enhance immersion and atmosphere without compromising Minecraft‚Äôs distinct visual identity.

## ‚ú® Features

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Lighting

- Reworked ambient lighting
- Direct lighting added with projected shadows
- Custom Ambient occlusion for environmental props
- Pixelated Lighting

### üß± Physically-Based Material Rendering

- Emissions for light sources or luminescent objects
- Reflectance and Roughness to simulate all kinds of material (metal, stone, wood, ice, ...)
- Screen Space Reflections (SSR) approximate reflections in real time
- Subsurface Scattering for translucent materials
- Porosity simulates moisture absorption on wet surfaces
- Normal Mapping supports through external texture packs or procedurally generated
- Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) simulates surface relief using texture height maps

### üå¶Ô∏è Atmospheric Effects

- New procedural sky box
- Simulated light shafts with volumetric fog
- Procedural animation of foliage and water surface

### üéûÔ∏è Post-Processing

- Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)
- Bloom
- Depth of Field with Bokeh simulation

### üåç All Environments

- Surface
- Underwater
- Underground
- Nether
- End
